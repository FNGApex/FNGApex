# Hi, I'm Apex
My passions include Software, Gaming, and Small Odd Job Tinkering.
My dream is to become a Software Developer with a focus on backend server development for Video Game companies
I am currently in highschool applying to CS oriented Colleges
I am a huge Video Game addict with over 7000 Hours on Steam and 3000 Hours on other platofrms
I love the idea of the real world, weather it's swapping out brakes on cars, fixing a leaking pipe, or retiling the bathroom, I will watch learn and do it myself simply because I have fun doing so.
Have a look around my profile and make sure to check out my CS Portfolio for inspirations, ideas, or even evaluation.

Best Regards
Apex {-}7
